## üì¶ Deployment

This section guides you through deploying the application either using Docker or by running it locally on your machine.

### Initial Setup

Before proceeding with either deployment method, you need to create and configure a `.env` file in the project directory. This file should contain the configurations for fetching historical data.

Create a `.env` file with the following content:
```
START_DATE=2022-01-01
END_DATE=2023-01-01
MARKETS=BTC_USDT,ETH_USDT,XRP_USDT
```
- `START_DATE` and `END_DATE` define the date range for the historical data.
- `MARKETS` lists the cryptocurrency pairs you want to fetch data for, separated by commas.

### Using Docker

Docker simplifies deployment by containerizing the application and its environment. Follow these steps to deploy using Docker:

1. **Build and Start the Containers**  
   Navigate to the project's root directory and run the following commands to build and start the Docker containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   - `docker-compose build` will build the Docker images.
   - `docker-compose up -d` will start the containers in detached mode.

2. **Verify the Deployment**  
   After executing the above commands, ensure that the containers are running correctly. You can check the status of the containers using:
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```

### Running Locally (Recommended)

If you prefer to run the application directly on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Install Necessary Go Packages**  
   The application requires certain Go packages to run. Install them by executing the following command in the root directory of the project:
   ```bash
   go get
   ```
   This command fetches and installs the dependencies listed in the `go.mod` file.

2. **Start the Application**  
   Once all dependencies are installed, start the application by running:
   ```bash
   ./run.sh
   ```
   This command compiles and executes the `parser/parser.go` and `downloader/downloader.go` files which will start downloading and parsing the data.
