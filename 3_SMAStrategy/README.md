A strategy modeled off of the SimoidStrategy for backtesting crypto markets could involve using simple moving average (SMA) crossovers to generate buy and sell signals. Here's a simplified version of how you could implement such a strategy:

1. Strategy Definition:
    Use two SMAs of different periods, such as a shorter-term SMA (e.g., 20-period) and a longer-term SMA (e.g., 50-period).
    Generate buy signals when the shorter-term SMA crosses above the longer-term SMA (a bullish crossover).
    Generate sell signals when the shorter-term SMA crosses below the longer-term SMA (a bearish crossover).
2. Data Collection:
    Gather historical price data for the cryptocurrency you want to backtest the strategy on. You'll need price data for the time period you want to analyze.
3. Signal Generation:
    Calculate the SMAs for both the shorter and longer periods based on the historical price data.
    Generate buy signals when the shorter-term SMA crosses above the longer-term SMA and sell signals when the opposite occurs.
4. Backtesting:
    Simulate trading based on the generated buy and sell signals over the historical data.
    Keep track of hypothetical trades, entry and exit points, and profits or losses.
5. Performance Analysis:
    Analyze the performance of the strategy based on backtest results.
    Calculate metrics such as total profit or loss, win rate, maximum drawdown, and risk-adjusted returns.
6. Optimization:
    Optionally, optimize the strategy by adjusting parameters such as the lengths of the SMAs to improve performance based on backtest results.
7. Out-of-Sample Testing:
    Validate the performance of the optimized strategy on a separate set of historical data that wasn't used in the initial backtest.
8. Paper Trading or Live Testing:
    Once satisfied with the performance in out-of-sample testing, consider paper trading or conducting live testing with a small amount of capital to further validate the strategy's effectiveness in real-world conditions.


Keep in mind that while simple moving average crossover strategies can be easy to implement and understand, they may not always perform optimally in all market conditions. It's essential to analyze the strategy's performance thoroughly and be prepared to adapt or refine it as needed. Additionally, consider incorporating risk management techniques to mitigate potential losses.
